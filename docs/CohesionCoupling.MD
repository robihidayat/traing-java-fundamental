## High Cohesion dan Low Coupling

#### cohesion

High cohesion is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused,
manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. 
High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and highly focused. 
Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities that increase the cohesive properties of a system. 
Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. 
Elements with low cohesion often suffer from being hard to comprehend, reuse.


Cohesion represents the degree to which a part of a code base forms a logically single, atomic unit

It can also be put as the number of connections inside some code unit. 
If the number is low, then the boundaries for the unit are probably chosen badly, 
the code inside the unit is not logically related.



#### coupling

Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, 
has knowledge of, or relies on other elements. 
Low coupling is an evaluative pattern that dictates how to assign responsibilities to support

- lower dependency between the classes,
- change in one class having lower impact on other classes,
- higher reuse potential.



#### high cohesion and low couple 

High cohesion means keeping parts of a code base that are related to each other in a single place. 
Low coupling, at the same time, is about separating unrelated parts of the code base as much as possible.
